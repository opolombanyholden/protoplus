h2. Protoplus.js Prototype Extensions Library

This is an extensions library for Prototype.js (v1.6+). Protoplus basictly adds new features to Prototype.js. 
h4. For example:

There are visual functions like A core animation function, textshadows, drag&drop, Instant Editables, Resizable text areas, Easy Tooltips, Star Rating Tool and Apple Like Search Box
And there are other functions supporting these functions such as, Color parsers, PHP-like GET parameter reader, selectable and un selectable elements, Cookie functions, Hower mimic,
Scroll methods, Element value getters.

Protoplus.js is not an animation Library or Frontend Framework it's just a compilation of commonly used functions build on prototype

h3. Examples

Protoplus inherits the usage of prototype library. So usage is as easy as prototype library.

h4. Including on page
<pre>
<code>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="prototype.js"></script>;
  <script type="text/javascript" src="protoplus.js"></script>;
</code>
</pre>
h4. Using shift function 

Shift function is a core animation function. It's basictly the same of @setStyle@ of prototype but shift sets the style by animations.
<pre>
<code>
  <script>;
    $('div').shift({ height:150, width:200, background:'#FFFFE0', duration:3, easing:'sineOut' });
  </script>;
</code>
</pre>
As you can see its as easy as using prototype.

I'll write a complete documentation soon.

Thanks.
